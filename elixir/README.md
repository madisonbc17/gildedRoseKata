## Running the Tests

This project uses Elixir's built-in testing framework, ExUnit.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Elixir installed. You can check by running:
    ```
    elixir --version
    ```
- Install project dependencies:
    ```
    mix deps.get
    ```

### Running the Tests

To run all tests, execute:
```
mix test
```

This will compile the project (if needed) and run all test files located in the `test/` directory.

### Additional Notes

- You can run a specific test file with:
    ```
    mix test test/<filename>_test.exs
    ```
- For more detailed output, use:
    ```
    mix test --trace
    ```
- Make sure your environment is configured as needed for the tests.

If you encounter any issues, please consult the project's documentation or open an issue.
